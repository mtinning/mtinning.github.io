I'm Mike, and this is my place for everything that I learn and want to share. I work as a Senior Software Developer for [Scott Logic](http://www.scottlogic.com) in Bristol, UK, a bespoke software consultancy specialising in financial services.

I am a full-stack developer - recently focusing more on front-end work with some exciting technologies like React and Redux - but I like to try to keep my finger on the pulse. I'm mainly interested in exploring how to build products that _just work_.

I am involved in organising [Bristech](http://bris.tech) and am passionate about nurturing and growing the tech community in the South West. Check out the [Bristech 2016 Conference](http://2016.bris.tech) - we're aiming to be the biggest tech conference in the South West! [Get in touch](mailto:mike@bris.tech) if you're interested in speaking at one of our [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/bristech).
