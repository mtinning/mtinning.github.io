I'm Mike, and this is my place for everything that I learn and want to share. I am a software developer based in Bristol, UK. I work for [Scott Logic](http://www.scottlogic.com) (we're always [hiring!](http://www.scottlogic.com/careers/vacancies/)).

I am also involved with [Bristech](http://bris.tech) and am passionate about nurturing and growing the tech community in the South West.
